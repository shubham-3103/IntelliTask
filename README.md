I had created an Intelligent Task Management System to automate the task management system.
Steps to follow:
1) Clone the repo
2) There will be 2 folders named: frontend and backend
3) Run npm i in both folders
4) add .env in frontend in which .env contains this "REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_cG9ldGljLWZvYWwtNjQuY2xlcmsuYWNjb3VudHMuZGV2JA" without double quotes
5) then run npm start in frontend and also open another terminal for backend and write npm start for backend also

ENJOY :)
